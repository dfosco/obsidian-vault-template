#### Goals

1. Keep the onboarding flow simple and intuitive
2. Streamline existing user flows and remove friction points
3. Define optimal first-ride experience: Should users see available rides immediately or complete profile setup first?
4. Prioritize both casual riders and corporate account journeys

> The first time I opened the app after creating my account, I was bombarded with promotions, map overlays, and various icons. As someone who uses ride-sharing apps regularly, it still took me a moment to figure out where to actually request a ride. The tutorials and pop-ups felt more like obstacles than helpful guides.

> I appreciated that the app asked about my commute patterns and preferred ride types during setup. It felt personalized at first. However, once I started using the app, none of those preferences seemed to influence my experience - I still saw the same generic ride options as everyone else.

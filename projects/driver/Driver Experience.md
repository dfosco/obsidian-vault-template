#### Goals

1. Simplify navigation patterns for drivers during active trips
2. Consolidate scattered features into a unified driver dashboard
3. Establish clear pathways for driver activation: Should drivers complete all verifications upfront or progressively unlock features?
4. Balance needs of part-time drivers and full-time professional drivers

> When I first started driving, the app's navigation between earnings, trips, and settings felt like a maze. I'd be trying to check my daily earnings while at a red light and couldn't find it quickly enough. The menu structure changes depending on whether you're online or offline, which is confusing when you're trying to learn the app.

> [!quote] #notitle 
> The onboarding asked me about my driving goals - extra income, full-time work, specific hours - which was great. But once I started driving, the app treats everyone the same. I drive nights and weekends only, but I get the same prompts and features as someone driving 50 hours a week. This feels like a missed opportunity compared to how [[Rider Experience]] personalizes their journey.
